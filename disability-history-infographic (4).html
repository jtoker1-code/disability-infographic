                <h2>The Historical Issue</h2>
                <p>For over a century, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities were systematically segregated from society and confined to large state institutions. These facilities, often called "schools" or "hospitals," promised care and education but delivered overcrowding, neglect, abuse, and inhumane conditions (Minnesota Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities, n.d.). The institutional era represents one of the darkest chapters in disability history, affecting millions of individuals and their families. The exposure of these conditions in the 1960s and 1970s sparked a nationwide movement toward deinstitutionalization that fundamentally changed how we support people with disabilities today (New York Civil Liberties Union [NYCLU], 2024).</p>

                <h2>Why This History Matters Today</h2>
                <p><strong>Understanding this history is essential for providing quality services.</strong> The institutional era teaches us that segregating and devaluing people with disabilities leads to abuse, neglect, and violation of basic human rights. When people are congregated and isolated from society, they become invisible and vulnerable.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This history reminds us that community inclusion is a hard-won right, not a privilege.</strong> The brave advocacy of people with disabilities, their families, journalists, and attorneys forced systemic change. The services we provide today—community residences, supported employment, inclusive education—exist because people fought against institutionalization.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We must remain vigilant.</strong> While large institutions have closed, concerns about "reinstitutionalization" persist when people with disabilities are placed in large congregate settings, nursing homes, or isolated from community life. Quality services today must honor the lessons of history by prioritizing choice, dignity, community integration, and the voices of people with disabilities themselves (NYCLU, 2024).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Every person deserves to live, work, and thrive in their community.</strong> As service providers, we have a responsibility to remember this history and ensure that people with disabilities receive supports that promote independence, community participation, and full inclusion—never returning to the segregation and dehumanization of the institutional era (OPWDD, 2025).</p>
